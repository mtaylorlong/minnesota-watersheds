		<p>Minnesota is full of water. It is the land of 10,000 lakes, and home to the headwaters of the Mississippi River. Water plays a key role in our landscape and culture, so it's important to understand where our water comes from. This site offers an introduction to Minnesota's watersheds. Minnesotans who are unfamiliar with watersheds can use our interactive map to locate the watershed they live in, then find out where their water comes from and where it goes using the Upstream/Downstream tool. </p>

		<p><strong>Contributors:</strong> This site was created as a group project for GIS 5574, <em>GIS and the Internet</em>, taught by Brian Fischer at the University of Minnesota in the Fall of 2013. Group members included: Mark Ellefson, Ben Gosack, David Hill, Taylor Long, and Elizabeth Puhl. </p>

		<h3>What is a Watershed?</h3>

		<p>To understand how water makes its way through a landscape, it's helpful to divide landscape into different units we call <em>watersheds</em>. A watershed can be described as an area of land that shares a common hydrologic network. Generally these areas are defined by choosing a point on a stream or river (aggregation point), and determining all of the adjacent land upstream that contributes water to that point. Watersheds can be delineated in a somewhat arbitrary manner, usually by water scientists for the purpose of studying the ways that water interacts with the environment. The largest level of watershed would be based on one of the major river systems in the United States (such as the Mississippi). Subsequently smaller basins can be delineated by subdividing each level of watershed into smaller watersheds. </p>

		<p>The United State Geological Survey (USGS) is a federal agency housed within the Department of Interior that deals with issues relating to water science. The USGS has no regulatory authority, rather it is a science organization that monitors the health of the environment. The organization is broken into four major science disciplines: biology, geography, geology, and hydrology. Watersheds are fundamental to these disciplines and more information can be found on their website. The USGS has developed a system for defining these areas: <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/wsp/wsp2294/pdf/wsp_2294.pdf">Seaber, 1987</a></p>

		<p>The system the USGS developed for mapping and identifying is based on <strong>Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUCs)</strong> that increase in length as the size of the watershed gets smaller (Seaber, 1987).</p>

			21 watershed regions, also known as HUC-2 watersheds.</p>

		<p>Minnesota contains the borders of four different HUC-2 watershed regions. The Souris-Red-Rainy Region (09) is based on the Red River, which borders Minnesota and the Dakotas. The Red River flows northerly and eventually terminates in Lake Winnipeg. The Great Lakes Region (04) is based on the chain of Great Lakes, which eventually terminates in the north Atlantic Ocean. The Upper Mississippi Region (07) is based on the Mississippi River, which eventually terminates in the Gulf of Mexico. The Missouri Region (10) is based on the Missouri River, which also terminates in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

		<p>Further segmentation of Minnesota HUC2 regions into HUC4 subregions shows how watershed subregions are based on increasingly-minor rivers, such as the Red (0902) and Rainy (0903) Rivers, the Minnesota (0702), St. Croix (0703), Mississippi Headwaters (0701), Des Moines (0710), and Black Root (0704) Rivers. </p>

		<p>These HUC regions become increasingly fine-grained, down to the neighborhood level. Each unit level group is nested within its parent HUC region.</p>

		<p>A detailed view of HUC8 Cataloging Units shows that in general, watershed boundaries are created along high-level elevations, which separate the Cataloging Units from each other. </p>
